Welcome to the course - Terraform in 21 Days!
We are using git branches to track changes
I made changes to this file to create a pull request!
Task2:
I have created an EC2 instance using Terraform by creating main.tf and provider.tf files.
I have pushed .gitignore file to ignore unneccesary files while commiting files.
